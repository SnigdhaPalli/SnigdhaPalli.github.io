      <h1>Doggos!</h1>
      <p>Dogs are incredibly important to me. Just seeing pictures of them give me so much happiness and help my mental
        health greatly. Though, I have never had one, I dream of being a dog mom one day. Dogs are so special and have
        so
        much love to give. Unfortunately, with classes, work, and an internship, I do not have the time to give a dog
        the
        attention that it needs, so I can not get one yet.
      </p>

      <h2>Here are my favorite breeds in no particular order:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pitbulls (aka Pibbles)</li>
        <li>Siberian Huskies (aka Moon Moon Floofs)</li>
        <li>Golden Retrievers (aka goldy bois)</li>
        <li>I give up. I love them all too much to pick favorites</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you have an interest in dogs, I highly reccomend following Dogspotting and Dogspotting Society on FB.
      </h3>
      <h4> Fun Fact: When I was a child, my mom told me she was deathly allergic to dogs to get me to stop asking for
        one. She was not.</h4>

    <div class="horses">
      <h1>Horses!</h1>
      <p>I started riding horses when I was 4 years old and they have since always been a part of my life. During high
        school, when I got an opportunity to do some independent research, so I decided to research equine-assisted
        psychotherapy (EAP). I started interning/working at a therapuetic riding facility, LeCheval Stable, and found
        that
        I liked teaching horse back riding and training horses much more than I liked competing. </p>
